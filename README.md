Web-based application for building questionnaires.

What is currently implemented:
1. Main Page: loads all avaliable quizes from database. Each quizz shows it's title, description, author, amount of questions and amount of completions. You can sort quizzes by name, ammount of questions and date of creation. Has a button to create a new quiz. Each quiz has a button to complete it, edit it or delete it (for edit and delete actions, asks password).
2. Quiz creation page: you can create a new quiz, choose what counts as a correct answer, and send this quiz to database (later is shown on main page).
3. Quiz page: you can beat any quiz. After completion, it shows your results.

To-to list (requires some updates):
1. Stylisation of page (current one is horrible).
2. Some quality of life changes (showing time it took to complete quiz, search page to search for quizzes by names).
